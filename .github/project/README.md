# Project Context Layer

**Purpose:** This directory stores project-specific context generated during adaptation.

## Files Created by Adaptation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `context.md` | Project metadata (detected stack, purpose, architecture type) |
| `workflows.md` | Common development commands and workflows |
| `architecture.md` | Analyzed project structure and patterns |
| `focus.instructions.md` | Behavioral constraints specific to this project |

## Structure

These files are auto-generated by running the adaptation workflow:

1. User runs: `npx create-aynorica .`
2. Aynorica initializes in project directory
3. On first interaction, Aynorica reminds: "Run adaptation to optimize for this project"
4. User triggers: "Adapt to this project"
5. Aynorica executes `.github/prompts/system/adaptation.prompt.md`
6. Files are created in this directory

## Lifecycle

- **Created:** During first adaptation
- **Updated:** When re-adaptation is triggered
- **Deleted:** When resetting to baseline configuration
- **Versioned:** Should be in `.gitignore` (project-specific, not repo-specific)

## Priority

Files in this directory have `priority: 1` in their frontmatter, meaning they override default instructions when conflicts arise.

Example:
```markdown
---
applyTo: "**"
priority: 1
---
```

This ensures project-specific focus rules take precedence over general capabilities.
