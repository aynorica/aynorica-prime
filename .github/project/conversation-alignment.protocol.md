# Conversation Alignment Workflow

Trigger: when asked to "align yourself with our conversation" (or similar).

1. Collect conversation signals: goals, decisions, constraints, open questions, blockers.
2. Extract communication traits: tone preferences, pacing, risk tolerance, trade-off appetite, disagreement cues.
3. Capture preventable errors: misunderstandings, missing context, prompt/knowledge gaps; note what knowledge would have avoided them.
4. Summarize actionable takeaways for the next session (1-3 bullets) and confirm with the user if needed.
5. Update `project/mental-model-map.md` under Session Learnings with date, key traits, pitfalls, and action items; add any new prompts/instructions needed to prevent repeats.
6. If blocked or information is missing, ask the user targeted questions to fill gaps, then finalize the update.
