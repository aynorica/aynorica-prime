# Project Context Layer

This directory is auto-generated during adaptation. Files here provide project-specific context.

**Generated files:**
- `context.md` — Project metadata (stack, purpose, architecture)
- `workflows.md` — Common commands and development workflows
- `architecture.md` — Detected patterns and structure
- `focus.instructions.md` — Project-specific behavioral constraints

**Do not commit:** These files are project-specific and should be in `.gitignore`.
