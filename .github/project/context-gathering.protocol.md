# Context-Gathering Protocol

Use this before solving any problem (technical or life/finance).

## When to Apply

**SKIP this protocol for:**

-   Simple queries with obvious answers
-   Direct questions about existing code
-   Commands you can execute immediately

**APPLY this protocol for:**

-   Multi-step tasks requiring planning
-   Unfamiliar domains or technologies
-   Decisions with significant trade-offs

## Protocol Steps

1. **Define** the problem and domains involved
2. **Check** `project/mental-model-map.md` for relevant prompts
3. **Load** prompts based on domain (see mental-model-map.md for mappings)
4. **Plan** briefly: goals, constraints, key risks
5. **Execute**, logging new insights
6. **Update** mental-model-map.md if novel learnings
